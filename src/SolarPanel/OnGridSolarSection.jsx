          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-900">
            An on-grid solar power plant, or grid-tied system, seamlessly
            integrates with the public electricity grid to provide a mix of
            solar and traditional power. This approach eliminates the need for
            costly battery storage required by off-grid systems, allowing for a
            more affordable initial setup. Homeowners and businesses benefit
            from the gridâ€™s backup during low solar output, ensuring
            uninterrupted power. Additionally, through net metering, surplus
            energy can be sold back to the grid, offering a return on
            investment. Opting for an on-grid system delivers a reliable,
            sustainable energy solution that reduces costs and supports
            environmental health, all without sacrificing convenience.
